* Command line parameters: Unify the background and sprite conversion with a single palette pass without pixel output, followed by pixel output, no palette offset for the stacked sprites
    * Looks good, except the first sprite is using palette 3 instead of the correct choice, which is causing a sprite with bright purple
        Look for rejectPalette, it does not seem to be working correctly and picking bright purple even though it doesn't match the forcedColourIndex


* outputSprites to be used to output sprite sheet data (4 bytes for hardware) as text



* Tidy code and unit test



* Option to learn palettes from one or more input sections before outputting pixels



* Detect identical output sprite data from the output binary point of view and avoid
    Instead use the original index for screen output



* Make the inputs and outputs configurable via a text config file, with includes
